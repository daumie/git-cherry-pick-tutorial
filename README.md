# git cherry-pick

## Short notes

- Doesn't take you back to the state the repository was in at the point in time
 of the cherry pick that you have commited.

- All it does is bring back the individual files or individual changes
associated with that 1 commit.

- Cherry picking command automatically registers a commit
